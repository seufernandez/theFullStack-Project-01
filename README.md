Hello you! This is my first FullStack Project!! 

I wanted to make a functional site that could manage a starship crew, having a page that could show every Captain and Crew Member, with a nice UI (My Designing past help a little haha), being able to edit each of them as well; and down here you can see some of my ways and tools used to build this project :)

You can see me showing the Project here!!!!

- Forms
- JS req.body
- Callback Functions
- - Routes.js, a main file wich objetive is to organize every data aimed to their respective Html(njk) page
- Back-End Validation
- Separating functions from routes (ex: routes.get("/captains", captains.get)// "captains" is a VAR wich brings captains.js that has all functions; xx.get | xx.create
- Creating Data.json using "fs"
- Creating and translating dates from timestamp to US format using Js
- Spread Operator, helping to update Captain´s info easily
- Age Calculator.
- Nunjucks Features: block content, include, extend. 
- MethodOverride to Update Captain´s info using PUT method
- Table loop, using data.json to show the Captains
- JS features used so far: Split, Slice (showing correct date format), Includes (route verification), Intl (date), and other basics features 

Well that's it, I hope you found interesting and Thank you for your time!!
